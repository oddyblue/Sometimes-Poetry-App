# Privacy Policy for Sometimes

**Last Updated: December 23, 2025**

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Sometimes ("the App") is designed with your privacy as a top priority. We believe in transparency about what data we collect and how it's used.

## Summary

**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.**

All data generated by the App stays on your device and is never transmitted to our servers. We have no servers, no analytics, and no tracking.

## Data Storage

### What's Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is stored **only on your device** using Apple's secure storage:

- **Poem Delivery History**: Records of which poems you've received and when
- **Favorites**: Poems you've marked as favorites
- **Preferences**: Your settings including:
  - Delivery frequency (poems per week)
  - Active hours (when poems can arrive)
  - Pause status (if you've paused delivery)

This data:
- Remains on your device
- Is never uploaded to our servers (we don't have servers)
- Can be deleted by deleting the App
- Is backed up to iCloud if you have App backup enabled in your device settings

**In Plain English:**

Sometimes is a simple poetry app that respects your privacy. All your favorites and settings stay on your phone. We only use the internet to get weather info (so we can pick fitting poems) and to process optional tips if you choose to support us. We don't track you, sell your data, or even know who you are. Enjoy the poetry. ❤️
